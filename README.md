# Polynomial Equation Calculator

## Overview

This C++ program calculates operations on polynomial equations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It supports equations in the form of `ax^n + bx^(n-1) + ... + cx + d`, where `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are coefficients and `n` is the exponent.

## Code Structure

The code consists of the following components:

- **Main Function**: Contains the main logic of the program, including input, processing, and output.
- **Polynomial Class**: Defines a class to represent polynomial equations and implements arithmetic operations on polynomials.
- **Utility Functions**: Contains utility functions for processing equations, such as splitting coefficients and exponents.

## Code Explanation

- **Polynomial Class**: The `Polynomial` class represents a polynomial equation. It overloads operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of polynomials.
- **Utility Functions**: These functions preprocess the input equations, identify coefficients and exponents, and perform necessary calculations.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter the first polynomial equation when prompted.
4. Enter the second polynomial equation when prompted.
5. The program will perform various operations on the equations and display the results.

## Dependencies

- None
